# ProjectXLoadTest
This describes a sample load test project I carried out on the patricia system. 
To run a performance load test, you must have installed apache jmeter on your device. This link navigates you to the download page if you havent - https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi -.
Once downloaded, you can import this file to view the test plan and use as a template for your test.
Note that you can easily update my paramters to suit your project where need be.
